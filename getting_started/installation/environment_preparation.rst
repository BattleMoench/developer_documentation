Environment preparation
=======================

Checking system compatibility
-----------------------------

We encourage users to stick to our recommendations of dependencies for the version of OXID eShop they plan to use
to ensure a hassle-free OXID eShop experiences.

You can read more on system requirements for our releases at our `OXID forge <https://oxidforge.org>`_ page
(e.g. `System requirements for OXID eShop 6.1.5 <https://oxidforge.org/en/oxid-eshop-version-6-1-5.html#toggle-id-2>`_ )
