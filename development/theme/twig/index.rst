Information about converting existing templates from Smarty to Twig can be found in
:doc:`OXID e-shop to Twig converter documentation <twig_converter/index>`

OXID eShop is introducing Twig templating engine. So far Smarty 2 engine was used with some Smarty 3 elements. Engine
was supported by many plugins which also has been reimplemented or migrated to Twig extensions. In this documentation
page will be described how OXID eShop custom plugins were migrated to Twig and how Twig can be extended.
