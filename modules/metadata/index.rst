Metadata
========

Since OXID eShop version 4.9.0 / 5.2.0
(`Release notes <https://www.oxid-esales.com/de/support-services/dokumentation-und-hilfe/oxid-eshop/releases/releases-2014/oxid-eshop-490520.html>`__)
each module has to have metadata set. This has to be done with a file metadata.php in the module directory.
