Update OXID eShop from version 4.10 / 5.3 to version 6
======================================================


@todo: Adapt this introduction text:

* adapt to Juergens introduction text
* this guide acts on the assumption you have an already running OXID eShop 4.10 / 5.3 with articles and user data
  and want to update it.
* If you do not have the newest patch release of 4.10 / 5.3, you should first update to this patch release.
* successively deactivate all modules and check if the shop still works
* Read the documentation about all changes carefully. In some cases you have to take actions, in some cases not. This
    depends on your OXID eShop, the modules or the theme you are using.
